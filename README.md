# TrainScheduler

This is an app that allows users to add trains to a schedule that calculates and updates the next arrival time and how many minutes until next arrival.

This app uses Firebase to store user input data, then manipulates that data to calculate the times needed. 

User input for train names and destinations are simple strings, first arrival time is a time, and frequency is an integer.
